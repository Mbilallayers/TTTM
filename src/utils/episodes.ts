              <p>According to the survey, they are over ZOOM, remote learning during the pandemic turned them off. The kids are zoomed out.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Gen Z desires networking and mentorship. Because of the lack of in-person mentoring throughout the pandemic, Gen Z is having a more challenging time navigating workplace norms (knowing how to act right at work) and forming meaningful connections at a crucial stage in their career development</p>

            Wall Street Journal blasts Elon Musk for creeping with Google co-founder‚Äôs wife
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>According to a shocking report published on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal, Elon Musk allegedly had a brief hookup with the wife of Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, last fall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>This allegedly led to Sergey Brin‚Äôs filing for divorce and the breakup of the long-standing friendship between the two tech billionaires.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              Messy Musky called it a ‚Äúhit piece." He shared a selfie with Sergey on Twitter and even said they partied together the night before and it was ‚Äúpositive vibes.‚Äù The allegations have since been denied by Sergey's soon-to-be ex-wife, Nicole Shanahan.

            Ex Coinbase manager locked up for insider trading

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Ishan Wahi, a former Coinbase product manager, and two other people were charged with insider trading on the Coinbase exchange that netted them about $1.5 million.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>This is the first case, that we know of, of insider trading in the cryptocurrency sector. While working at Coinbase, these guys sold information to third parties and made investments in cryptocurrencies before they were listed on the exchange using their insider knowledge.</p>

            <li>

              Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi were taken into custody at the airport, trying to catch a flight to India. Sameer Ramani, Wahi's buddy and partner, is still at large.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Elon Musk, better known on the show as "Messy Musky," has been at odds with Twitter since he pulled out of the $44 billion deal to acquire the site and was sued to hold him to it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A new "Termination Letter" was submitted by Musk's attorneys to the SEC, and they are now attempting a different strategy: Mention Peiter "Mudge" Zatko, a Twitter whistleblower.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Former Twitter security head Zatko alleged that the social media company had misled the SEC, among other things.</p>

              <p>California has a lofty goal of banning the sale of all combustion-engine passenger vehicles by 2035  in the name of reducing its level of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Before the ultimate ban, 35% of newly sold vehicles must utilize renewable energy by 2026, and 68% by 2030. Currently, EVs account for 16% of new car sales in the state.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Every extra gas-powered car sold by automakers that don't meet the production goal might result in a fine of up to $20,000.</p>

            <li>
              <p>If the goals turn out to be unattainable, the state may amend the law. Once the bill passes, Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign it into law.</p>
